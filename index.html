        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>As DFW based parents of two children, my wife and I began Gold Star Application Review with the mission of helping families in the metroplex achieve their academic goals.</p>
        <p>When navigating the DFW private school admissions landscape for our oldest son, we found ourselves overwhelmed with information from schools, online forums, and parent groups. After identifying schools that resonated with our child the most, we wanted to make sure that we were crafting an application package that highlighted his personality, while demonstrating our family's fit within the school's broader community.</p>
        <p>While we considered working with one of the many existing comprehensive admissions consulting practices, what we really needed was impartial, candid, firsthand feedback from parents within the community, to help supplement our own research.</p>
        <p>In this spirit, Gold Star Application Review seeks to support families by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Providing guidance into best practices on engaging with the school community prior to application submission</em></li>
          <li><em>Helping craft, and review parent statements/admissions essays</em></li>
          <li><em>Preparing parents and students for interviews through mock sessions</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are <strong style="color: green;">not</strong> career academic consultants. We are parents who are excited to share our learnings with prospective families, while providing open and honest feedback to help guide students to outcomes that are the best for them.</p>
