        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>As DFW-based parents of two children, we began Gold Star Application Review with the mission of helping families in the metroplex achieve their academic goals. When navigating the private school admissions landscape for our oldest son, we often felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information from schools, online forums, and parent groups. After narrowing down the schools that resonated with our family, we wanted to ensure that our application package authentically reflected our child’s personality and conveyed how our family would contribute to the broader school community. While we considered working with one of the many existing comprehensive admissions consulting practices, what we really needed was impartial, candid, firsthand feedback from parents within the community, to help supplement our own research. In this spirit, Gold Star Application Review seeks to support families by providing guidance on best practices for engaging with the school community prior to application submission, helping craft and review parent statements/admissions essays, and preparing parents and students for interviews through mock sessions. We are not career academic consultants. We are parents who are excited to share our learnings with prospective families, while providing open and honest feedback to help guide students to outcomes that are the best for them.</p>
